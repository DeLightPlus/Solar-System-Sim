Progress Report — Solar System Visualization Project

Date: 2025-09-05

✅ Summary

Built a React Three Fiber-based solar system scene featuring the Sun, 8 planets, and moons.

Rendered celestial bodies using textured spheres and animated them with realistic rotation and orbital motion.

Implemented elliptical orbit trails using THREE.EllipseCurve to reflect orbital eccentricity.

Developed a reusable OrbitTrail component with customizable semi-major/semi-minor axes, color, and opacity.

Added ambient and point lighting to simulate solar illumination.

Integrated OrbitControls for smooth interactive camera navigation (with auto-rotate support).

Hooked into useFrame for frame-based animation updates of planets and moons.

Established modular structure for easy feature scaling and maintenance.

Introduced hover tooltips and planet info panels to improve engagement and education.

🆕 New Feature: Educational Intro Overlay

Objective:
Provide an immersive, guided introduction to the solar system to:

Educate users unfamiliar with space concepts.

Jog the memory of older users or non-astronomy audiences.

Prevent early interaction with UI while explaining core ideas.

🌌 Current Setup

Background: 3D solar system scene with slow auto-rotation for ambient visual context.

Camera: Positioned to view the planetary lineup, subtly moving during intro phase.

UI Layer:

PlanetCard bar docked at the bottom (disabled initially).

WelcomeIntro overlay as a modal walkthrough at the top.

Interactivity:

Planet cards are disabled until the tutorial concludes.

Only overlay navigation is active: Next, Back, Finish.

🧭 Planned Tutorial Content (Overlay)

Each step includes:
🔸 Image (placeholder for now)
🔸 Title + Description
🔸 Navigation buttons (Next / Back / Finish)

🪐 1. What is a Solar System?

"A solar system is a star and everything bound to it by gravity — planets, moons, comets, asteroids, dust, and more. Ours orbits the Sun."

☀️ 2. Why is it called the 'Solar' System?

"Because 'Sol' is the Latin word for the Sun. Other systems orbiting different stars are simply called star systems."

🌍 3. What is a Planet?

"A planet is a celestial body that orbits a star, is massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity, and has cleared its orbital path."

🪐 4. How many planets are in our solar system?

"There are 8 recognized planets in our solar system — Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune."

🌌 5. What’s beyond the Solar System?

"Billions of other stars like our Sun — many with their own planetary systems, called exoplanets."

🎉 6. Wrap-up

"You're ready to explore! Click on any planet to learn more about it."

🧠 UX Notes

Interactions are gated during the tutorial to prevent distractions.

Planet cards are enabled only after the tutorial ends.

The intro is shown only once unless manually reset via localStorage.

Designed for clarity across mobile and desktop experiences.

🛠 Next Steps

Add planet-specific tutorials when selected (deep dive cards).

Support dynamic camera zoom to focus on clicked planets.

Introduce atmospheric glows, planet rings, and shadow realism.

Add performance profiling for optimization at scale.

Optional: Enable time controls (day/year cycles).
