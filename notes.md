# Progress Report - Solar System Visualization Project

**Date:** 2025-09-05

## Summary

- Developed a React Three Fiber-based solar system simulation featuring a sun, four planets, and moons.  
- Implemented textured spheres for planets and moons with realistic rotation speeds and distances.  
- Created elliptical orbit trails reflecting orbital eccentricity for each planet.  
- Orbit trails visually represent semi-major and semi-minor axes using `THREE.EllipseCurve`.  
- Added ambient and point lighting to simulate sun illumination.  
- Included interactive camera controls via `OrbitControls` for smooth navigation around the scene.  
- Optimized planet and moon movement with the `useFrame` hook for real-time animation.  
- Established a reusable `OrbitTrail` component capable of rendering elliptical orbits with customizable colors and opacity.  
- Ensured modular component structure to facilitate future feature additions.

## Next Steps

- Implement orbital inclination and axial tilt for planets.  
- Add atmospheric glow and ring effects.  
- Enhance visual realism with shadows and advanced lighting.  
- Introduce user interactivity like info popups and time controls.  
- Optimize performance for larger solar system models.
